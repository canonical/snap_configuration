# snap configuration

When a robotics application is snapped, one might want to use it on multiple different robots.
Reusing the same snap means that we must be able to configure the snap to the specificity of a robot once installed on it.

This repository is hosting examples of the ROS snap configuration how-to-guides from the [ubuntu.com/robotics/docs](ubuntu.com/robotics/docs).

Please refer the [main README.md](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/snap_configuration/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
